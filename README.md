# phpauthplugin

This plugin allows you to use a phpBB3 database as the authentication store for Trac. 
It is a fork of the original plugin at [PhpBbAuthPlugin], to support phpBB3.1 with >PHP5.3.7 using Blowfish encyption.

It requires the Trac Account Manager, [phpbb-python] for supporting the phpass hash, and [bcrypt] for the Blowfish hash.

For installation instructions, refers to [PhpBbAuthPlugin].
